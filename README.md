# Sudoku Solver
the goal is to solve any grid that may have entered the algorithm. For practical reasons the grids will not be paid by hand but automatically generated by the program with several levels of difficulty.

- very difficult only only 17 boxes are given
- difficult only 26 boxes are given
- average only 33 boxes are given
- easy only 40 boxes are given 
- beginner only 50 boxes are given

The choice of the level will create a grid with just the right number of empty squares to test to fill it.
The algorithm uses Google's OR-Tools to solve the problem. The goal is to define the bounds bound to the environment and let the program find the solution.
## OR-Tools - Google Optimization Tools
[Google Optimization Tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization) (a.k.a., OR-Tools) is an open-source, fast and portable software suite for solving combinatorial optimization problems.

The suite contains:
- A constraint programming solver;
- A linear programming solver;
- Wrappers around commercial and other open source solvers, including mixed integer solvers;
- Bin packing and knapsack algorithms;
- Algorithms for the Traveling Salesman Problem and Vehicle Routing Problem;
- Graph algorithms (shortest paths, min cost flow, max flow, linear sum assignment).
